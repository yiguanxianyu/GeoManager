# API Change Requests

This document is the frontend-to-backend handoff queue for API contract changes.

Frontend owns `docs/openapi.yaml` and `mock/prism/examples/*.json`. Whenever frontend changes an endpoint, response field, request body, status code, permission behavior, or mock example that requires backend implementation, add or update one API change entry here. Backend uses these entries to update Django behavior and tests.

## Status Definitions

- `Proposed`: Frontend has identified a requirement, but the contract or mock example may still be incomplete.
- `ContractReady`: `docs/openapi.yaml`, generated API types, and mock examples are ready for backend implementation.
- `Implementing`: Backend is implementing the contract.
- `BackendReady`: Backend implementation and backend tests are complete.
- `Verified`: Frontend has verified the real backend against the contract.
- `Blocked`: Contract, implementation, data, or permission behavior needs a decision before continuing.
- `Superseded`: Replaced by a later API change request.

```

## API-20260615-001 - Initial Mock Separation Contract

- Status: ContractReady
- Owner: Frontend / Backend
- Endpoints: multiple endpoints in `docs/openapi.yaml`
- Change type: mock data, status code, permission behavior
- OpenAPI change: APIs must return JSON error bodies for unauthenticated and CSRF failures; response examples define representative auth, admin, catalog, vector, and raster data.
- Mock examples: `mock/prism/examples/*.json`
- Frontend reason: support frontend development against Prism without a running backend.
- Backend implementation notes: ensure real Django responses conform to `docs/openapi.yaml`, especially `401 {"detail":"请先登录"}` and `403 {"detail":"CSRF 验证失败"}` for API requests.
- Verification: run backend API tests plus `cd frontend && pnpm run check:api && pnpm run mock:build`.
- Result: backend implementation pending final owner verification.
## API-20260615-002 - Login Page Public Overview

- Status: ContractReady
- Owner: Frontend / Backend
- Endpoints: `GET /api/login/overview/`
- Change type: new endpoint, response fields, mock data
- OpenAPI change: Adds a public login overview response containing platform brand text, hero copy, capability tags, four metric cards, service status summary, node legend, and footer statistics notice.
- Mock examples: `mock/prism/examples/05-login-overview.json`
- Frontend reason: The rebuilt login page currently preserves the approved visual design with static display values, but the data structure must be contract-ready so future frontend work can replace static values with generated OpenAPI types after backend implementation.
- Backend implementation notes: Implement a no-auth Django API endpoint that returns only public overview data. Do not expose internal paths, user records, permission group details, server resource internals, or private data inventory. Recommended cache TTL is 60 seconds to 5 minutes.
- Verification: run backend API tests for `GET /api/login/overview/`, then run `cd frontend && pnpm run check:api && pnpm run mock:build`.
- Result: Backend implementation pending; frontend login UI remains visually unchanged and does not directly modify backend code.

## API-20260616-001 - Workspace Snapshots, Upload Stats, and Data Overview

- Status: Implementing
- Owner: Frontend / Backend
- Endpoints: `GET/POST /api/catalog/workspaces/`, `GET/POST /api/catalog/workspaces/{workspaceId}/`, `POST /api/catalog/import/preview/`, `POST /api/catalog/import/validate/`, `POST /api/catalog/import/commit/`, `GET /api/auth/me/`, `GET /api/users/`, `GET /api/admin/dashboard/`, `GET /api/admin/data/resources/`
- Change type: new endpoint, response fields, request body, permission behavior, mock data
- OpenAPI change: Adds private workspace scene APIs for `project` and `topic`; import preview/validate responses include duplicate target metadata; import endpoints accept `core.upload_data` or `catalog.maintain_dataresource`; user permissions include `canUploadData`, `canViewDataOverview`, and `groupPermissions`; Dashboard may include `dataOverview`; data resources include `sizeBytes`, `itemCount`, and structured `uploader`.
- Mock examples: `mock/prism/examples/10-admin-auth.json`, `mock/prism/examples/20-admin-dashboard-data.json`, `mock/prism/examples/30-catalog-vector.json`
- Frontend reason: Support one-step query-and-load, blocking duplicate upload warnings, local layer autosave with explicit server save as 工程/专题, Dashboard data overview, and clearer inherited-vs-direct permission display.
- Backend implementation notes: Add `WorkspaceScene`; persist `DataResource.size_bytes` and `item_count`; treat `DataResource.maintainer` as uploader; enforce workspace ownership; reject duplicate import targets when `overwrite=false`; initialize default `普通用户` group with upload/load/query permissions.
- Verification: run `cd frontend && pnpm run generate:api && pnpm run check:api && pnpm run api:changes:check && pnpm run mock:build`, plus backend workspace/import/dashboard/auth tests.
- Result: Backend and frontend implementation in progress.

## API-20260617-002 - Workspace Snapshot Raw Data Guard

- Status: BackendReady
- Owner: Frontend / Backend
- Endpoints: `POST /api/catalog/workspaces/`, `POST /api/catalog/workspaces/{workspaceId}/`
- Change type: request body, status code
- OpenAPI change: Clarifies that `WorkspaceSceneSnapshot` is a lightweight snapshot containing layer structure, query conditions, spatial ranges, resource references, symbolization, raster rendering references, and view state; raw GeoJSON feature collections, table rows, and query result data bodies are not allowed. Oversized workspace save requests return 413.
- Mock examples: N/A; behavior is covered by backend integration tests rather than Prism examples.
- Frontend reason: Saving 工程/专题 must persist how to reproduce the current workspace, not duplicate source/query data into `WorkspaceScene.snapshot`.
- Backend implementation notes: Reject snapshots containing `geojson` or `FeatureCollection.features`; check workspace save body size before reading `request.body` to avoid `RequestDataTooBig` security log tracebacks.
- Verification: run backend workspace API tests and `cd frontend && pnpm run generate:api && pnpm run check:api && pnpm run api:changes:check`.
- Result: Backend guard and frontend lightweight snapshot serialization implemented.

## API-20260617-001 - Dedicated Guest Login

- Status: BackendReady
- Owner: Frontend / Backend
- Endpoints: `POST /api/auth/guest-login/`
- Change type: new endpoint, permission behavior
- OpenAPI change: Adds public CSRF-protected guest login endpoint returning the existing `LoginResponse`; documents dedicated `guest` account and separate `游客` group permissions.
- Mock examples: N/A
- Frontend reason: Login page needs a no-password visitor entry while keeping visitor permissions distinct from registered normal users.
- Backend implementation notes: Create or repair the `guest` account with unusable password, active state, display name “游客”, and only the `游客` group. Protect the account from delete, disable, password reset, group changes, and direct permission updates.
- Verification: run backend auth/admin tests plus `cd frontend && pnpm run generate:api && pnpm run check:api && pnpm run api:changes:check`.
- Result: Implemented in backend and ready for frontend verification.

## API-20260618-001 - Non-Geographic Table Analytics

- Status: ContractReady
- Owner: Frontend / Backend
- Endpoints: `GET /api/catalog/resources/{id}/nongeo-analytics/`, `POST /api/catalog/resources/{id}/table-query/`
- Change type: new endpoint, response fields, permission behavior, mock data
- OpenAPI change: Adds a non-geographic resource analytics response for table/gene resources, including resource summary, field profiles, categorical distributions, numeric distributions, correlation matrix, table preview, and short insights. Adds a table query endpoint returning rows rather than GeoJSON, with attribute filters, sorting, limit, and offset.
- Mock examples: `mock/prism/examples/35-catalog-nongeo.json`; `mock/prism/examples/30-catalog-vector.json` now includes a representative table resource in the resource list.
- Frontend reason: `/nongeo` needs a rich analysis workspace for ecological table data without reusing vector GeoJSON query semantics or adding backend-specific assumptions in React.
- Backend implementation notes: Implement read-only Django endpoints under catalog. `nongeo-analytics` should support `table` and `gene` DataResource records visible to the current user, derive stats from the SQLite table or relevant non-geographic storage, cap expensive distinct/top-N/correlation work, and return `400` for unsupported spatial-only resource types. `table-query` should apply the same attribute operators as `AttributeFilter`, support deterministic pagination/sorting, and never include geometry. Enforce `core.browse_data` for analytics and `core.query_data` for row query; continue applying DataResource `access_groups`.
- Verification: run backend catalog API tests for table/gene resources, permission denial tests, Prism mock build, and frontend API generation/type checks.
- Result: Backend implementation pending; frontend can develop against the contract and Prism mock without modifying backend code.
