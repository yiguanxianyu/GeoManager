# API Change Requests

This document is the frontend-to-backend handoff queue for API contract changes.

Frontend owns `docs/openapi.yaml` and `mock/prism/examples/*.json`. Whenever frontend changes an endpoint, response field, request body, status code, permission behavior, or mock example that requires backend implementation, add or update one API change entry here. Backend uses these entries to update Django behavior and tests.

## Status Definitions

- `Proposed`: Frontend has identified a requirement, but the contract or mock example may still be incomplete.
- `ContractReady`: `docs/openapi.yaml`, generated API types, and mock examples are ready for backend implementation.
- `Implementing`: Backend is implementing the contract.
- `BackendReady`: Backend implementation and backend tests are complete.
- `Verified`: Frontend has verified the real backend against the contract.
- `Blocked`: Contract, implementation, data, or permission behavior needs a decision before continuing.
- `Superseded`: Replaced by a later API change request.

## Entry Template

```markdown
## API-YYYYMMDD-001 - Short Change Title

- Status: Proposed | ContractReady | Implementing | BackendReady | Verified | Blocked | Superseded
- Owner: Frontend requester / backend implementer
- Endpoints: `METHOD /api/...`
- Change type: response fields | request body | status code | permission behavior | mock data | new endpoint | removed endpoint
- OpenAPI change: concise summary of schema/status/permission changes
- Mock examples: `mock/prism/examples/...json`
- Frontend reason: UI workflow or data requirement
- Backend implementation notes: expected service/view/test work
- Verification: commands or response checks required before marking implemented
- Result: current backend/frontend verification result
```

## API-20260714-005 - Registration Email And Research Role Application

- Status: Verified
- Owner: Frontend/backend implementer
- Endpoints: `POST /api/auth/register/`, `GET /api/admin/role-applications/`, `POST /api/admin/role-applications/{applicationId}/review/`, `POST /api/users/`
- Change type: request body | validation behavior | new endpoints | permission behavior | mock data
- OpenAPI change: Makes registration and administrator-created account email mandatory, defines lowercase non-empty email uniqueness, adds `accountPurpose` and conditional research-application fields, returns the submitted application, and adds permission-gated list/review endpoints.
- Mock examples: `mock/prism/examples/00-public-auth.json`, `mock/prism/examples/10-admin-auth.json`
- Frontend reason: Self-registration must map safely to the existing built-in roles without allowing users to grant themselves elevated permissions, while the current no-mail transition still requires reliable contact data and a clear administrator-assisted password reset path.
- Backend implementation notes: Keep every self-registered account in the ordinary-user group, persist a separate pending research-role application, normalize and reserve unique email identities, approve by replacing the ordinary role with the research role while retaining custom roles, reject without changing permissions, and record review operations.
- Verification: Run OpenAPI lint/generation/change checks, Prism example injection, Django migration/system checks, focused registration/email/review tests, frontend registration/admin tests, typecheck and production build.
- Result: Verified with OpenAPI lint and regenerated client types, bundled YAML/HTML documentation, Prism example injection, API change tracking, Django system and migration checks, 13 focused registration/email/role-review permission tests, frontend typecheck, 185 frontend unit tests, production build, and targeted system-Chrome browser tests for research registration and administrator approval. The repository-wide browser command still requires its configured Playwright Chromium download; the broader existing core suite retains unrelated Windows TOML/path/encoding failures.

## API-20260714-003 - Formal Map Composition And Thematic Product Workflow

- Status: Verified
- Owner: Frontend/backend implementer
- Endpoints: `GET/POST /api/catalog/map-compositions/`, `GET/POST /api/catalog/map-compositions/{compositionId}/`, `POST /api/catalog/map-compositions/{compositionId}/versions/`, `GET /api/catalog/map-compositions/{compositionId}/versions/{versionNumber}/file/`
- Change type: new endpoint | new models | request/response schemas | multipart upload | permission behavior | binary download | mock data
- OpenAPI change: Adds typed map composition drafts linked to project workspaces, lightweight layout JSON, immutable exported versions, status transitions, PNG/JPG/PDF metadata, preview/download URLs, and six composition permission flags in the current-user response.
- Mock examples: `mock/prism/examples/50-map-compositions.json`
- Frontend reason: The geographic workspace needs a complete project-to-layout-to-thematic-product workflow with paper settings, map frames, legends, north arrows, scale bars, overview maps, grids, sources, notes, preview, versioning and export.
- Backend implementation notes: Persist composition metadata in the application database, store generated artifacts only under the TOML-driven business exports directory, reject embedded source data/Data URLs in layout JSON, validate uploaded PNG dimensions, convert the client-rendered master image to the selected output format, enforce Django permissions and record audit targets.
- Verification: Run OpenAPI lint/generation/check, Prism bundle/example injection, Django migrations/system checks, focused map-composition API/model/export tests, frontend typecheck/tests/build, and a signed-in browser workflow covering create, edit, version generation, preview, download and publish.
- Result: Verified with focused map-composition/workspace/auth Django tests, OpenAPI lint and regenerated types, API change tracking, Prism example injection, 179 frontend unit tests, frontend typecheck, production build and targeted lint. A signed-in real-browser workflow completed project creation, composition editing, geographic and Web Mercator grids, overview map, legend/source/note rendering, draft save, PNG V1 generation and preview, publish, unpublish and archive. The repository browser-test command remains unavailable because its configured Playwright Chromium executable is not installed.

## API-20260714-004 - Shared Workspace Visibility And Superadmin Invariant

- Status: Verified
- Owner: Frontend/backend implementer
- Endpoints: `GET/POST /api/catalog/workspaces/`, `GET/POST /api/catalog/workspaces/{workspaceId}/`, `GET /api/admin/workspaces/`, `POST /api/admin/workspaces/{workspaceId}/`
- Change type: permission behavior | response fields | request body | mock data | data migration
- OpenAPI change: Changes the normal workspace list/detail from owner-only to owner-or-role-visible active objects with a superadmin all-object bypass; adds access groups and per-object owner/edit/delete flags, returns selectable access groups, and accepts `accessGroupIds` on create/update while keeping the superadmin group server-controlled.
- Mock examples: `mock/prism/examples/30-catalog-vector.json`, `mock/prism/examples/25-admin-managed-assets.json`
- Frontend reason: Superadmins and explicitly shared users must be able to discover and load engineering/topic snapshots saved by other uploaders, while owners need to set visibility during save and shared viewers must not receive edit/delete controls.
- Backend implementation notes: Centralize workspace visibility filtering, force the protected superadmin group onto new and historical workspaces, keep normal updates owner-only, exclude the superadmin group from selectable scopes, and preserve inactive objects only in the admin management surface.
- Verification: Run migration checks, focused workspace API tests, OpenAPI generation/lint/change checks, frontend typecheck and focused workspace/admin tests, then verify list counts, shared loading, owner-only editing and admin map loading in a signed-in browser.
- Result: Verified with OpenAPI lint and generated types, Prism bundle/example injection, API change request validation, Django system/migration checks, focused map-composition/workspace/auth tests, frontend typecheck, 179 unit tests and production build. Browser workflow verification is tracked separately because it requires a running signed-in local stack with map tile access.

## API-20260714-001 - Reliable Active Account And Login Statistics

- Status: Verified
- Owner: Frontend/backend implementer
- Endpoints: `GET /api/admin/dashboard/`
- Change type: statistics behavior clarification | mock data | documentation clarification
- OpenAPI change: Keeps the existing response shape but redefines `activeUsers.count` and `series[].count` as authenticated API activity metrics, while `loginCount` and `ranking[].loginCount` remain successful session-creation metrics. Successful authentication includes password login, guest login, and registration auto-login.
- Mock examples: `mock/prism/examples/20-admin-dashboard-data.json`
- Frontend reason: A session that remains signed in across midnight was shown as zero active users even while the account was actively querying and importing data, because the previous implementation treated login events as activity.
- Backend implementation notes: Record at most one activity row per user and local-time hour, backfill historical successful operation logs, identify authentication events with stable event codes instead of Chinese display text, preserve principal visibility rules, and keep login totals separate from activity counts.
- Verification: run the audit migration check, focused dashboard/auth tests, OpenAPI generation/checks, frontend route tests, typecheck, and formatting checks.
- Result: Verified by focused backend tests covering carried sessions, stable login events, daily series, and existing dashboard permissions, plus OpenAPI/frontend checks.

## API-20260714-002 - Geographic And Non-Geographic Resource Isolation

- Status: Verified
- Owner: Frontend/backend implementer
- Endpoints: `GET /api/catalog/resources/`
- Change type: query parameter | response field | filtering behavior | mock data
- OpenAPI change: Adds `spatialClass=spatial|non_spatial` and `DataResource.spatialClass`; documents that vector/raster resources are spatial while table/gene/document/image resources are non-spatial, independently of `domainType`.
- Mock examples: `mock/prism/examples/30-catalog-vector.json`
- Frontend reason: Plain Excel/CSV imports without usable longitude/latitude columns must disappear from the map resource list and appear immediately in the non-geographic workspace resource list, including after manual refresh.
- Backend implementation notes: Derive the resource classification from `DataResource.data_type`, validate the query value, preserve existing permission and business-domain filters, and return the classification in serialized resources.
- Verification: run OpenAPI lint/generation, API change request check, focused catalog list/import tests, frontend typecheck and focused workspace tests, then validate both workspaces in the local browser.
- Result: Verified with OpenAPI lint and generated types, Prism bundle/example injection, API change request validation, focused Django resource/import tests, frontend typecheck and unit tests, and a real signed-in Chrome check confirming the imported SQLite table appears and refreshes in `/nongeo` while remaining absent from `/map`. The repository browser-test command remains unavailable because its configured Playwright Chromium binary is not installed.

## API-20260713-001 - Vector Source Import And Business Domain

- Status: Verified
- Owner: Frontend/backend implementer
- Endpoints: `POST /api/catalog/vector-import/preview/`, `POST /api/catalog/vector-import/validate/`, `POST /api/catalog/vector-import/commit/`, `GET /api/data-schema/summary/`, `GET /api/catalog/resources/`
- Change type: new endpoint | request body | response fields | enum addition | mock data | backend model
- OpenAPI change: Adds typed vector source preview, validation, and commit responses for Shapefile ZIP, GeoJSON, and GeoPackage; extends `DataDomainType` with `vector`; documents CRS, encoding, geometry quality, duplicate-name, access-group, and permission behavior.
- Mock examples: `mock/prism/examples/30-catalog-vector.json`, `mock/prism/examples/45-domain-schema.json`
- Frontend reason: The admin import page must replace the previous “vector import not yet supported” result with a complete typed workflow that previews source layers, allows encoding/CRS and geometry-quality decisions, and registers the imported resource for immediate use in the geographic workspace.
- Backend implementation notes: Add `VectorDataset`, retain original uploads under the configured research vector directory, normalize valid geometries to EPSG:4326 in the shared GeoPackage, create `DataResource`/`MapLayer`/`ResourceDomain`/`SourceDataset`, reuse existing access groups and audit logging, and keep existing Excel/CSV import endpoints unchanged.
- Verification: run OpenAPI lint/generation, API change request check, Prism mock build, Django migration/system checks, focused vector import integration tests, frontend API client tests, frontend typecheck, formatting checks, and production build.
- Result: Verified with OpenAPI lint and generated types, Prism bundle/example injection, API change request validation, Django system and focused migration checks, vector import/domain/schema integration tests, actual GB18030 Shapefile preview, frontend typecheck, targeted lint/format checks, mock example tests, and production build. Browser-mode API tests remain blocked because the configured Playwright Chromium executable is not installed; the broader legacy import suite still contains existing Windows GeoPackage/SQLite file-lock failures and one unrelated coordinate-format expectation failure.

## API-20260710-002 - Data Overview Spatial Summary

- Status: Verified
- Owner: Frontend/backend implementer
- Endpoints: `GET /api/admin/dashboard/`
- Change type: response fields | mock data | documentation clarification
- OpenAPI change: Extends `AdminDashboardDataOverviewScope` with required `spatialSummary`, plus typed `AdminDashboardSpatialSummary`, `AdminDashboardResourceExtent`, and `AdminDashboardSpatialHeatmapCell` schemas. The field is returned separately under `ownUploads` and permission-gated `visibleResources`; legacy top-level system total fields remain unchanged.
- Mock examples: `mock/prism/examples/20-admin-dashboard-data.json`
- Frontend reason: The data management overview needs first-stage visualizations for spatial coverage, heatmap distribution, data type composition, coverage ranking, and uploader contribution without fetching full resource geometry or bypassing permission scope.
- Backend implementation notes: Compute `spatialSummary` only after the relevant queryset has been scoped to the current user (`maintainer=current user` for `ownUploads`, `filter_accessible(...)` for `visibleResources`). Use registered resource/layer/raster bbox metadata only; do not scan raw feature data in the dashboard request. Ordinary users must never receive all-platform spatial summaries or uploader rankings.
- Verification: run OpenAPI generation, Prism mock build, focused dashboard backend tests, frontend typecheck, and route/browser checks for the data overview page. Do not run scripts containing bulk delete commands.
- Result: Verified with OpenAPI lint/generation, Prism bundle/example injection, API change request check, focused dashboard backend tests, Django system check, frontend typecheck, targeted lint/format checks for touched frontend files, and Vite production build. Browser route test could not run because the local Playwright Chromium executable is not installed.

## API-20260710-001 - Vector Manual Graduated Symbolization

- Status: Verified
- Owner: Frontend/backend implementer
- Endpoints: `GET /api/layers/`, `POST /api/admin/data/resources/{id}/`
- Change type: response fields | request body | mock data | documentation clarification
- OpenAPI change: Extends `GraduatedRenderer.method` with `manual`. Manual graduated symbolization continues to use existing `classes[].min/max/color/iconImage/size/visible` fields, with no new endpoint or backend model.
- Mock examples: `mock/prism/examples/30-catalog-vector.json` changes the elevation graduated vector example to `method="manual"` with custom range labels and custom min/max boundaries.
- Frontend reason: Users need to define non-equal, domain-specific numeric ranges for fields such as elevation, NDVI, and salinity, while still editing colors, icons, sizes, and visibility per class.
- Backend implementation notes: Existing JSONField storage and serializers should pass the documented `symbolization` object through unchanged. Permission behavior remains the same as other custom symbolization edits.
- Verification: run OpenAPI type generation, Prism mock build, API change request check, focused frontend symbolization tests, frontend typecheck, backend Django check, and production build.
- Result: Verified with OpenAPI type generation, Prism mock bundle injection, Redocly lint, API change request check, focused frontend symbolization tests, frontend TypeScript checks, Django system check, and Vite production build. Redocly still reports two pre-existing unused schema warnings unrelated to this change.

## API-20260704-001 - Other Business Data Type

- Status: Verified
- Owner: Frontend/backend implementer
- Endpoints: `GET /api/data-schema/summary/`, `GET /api/catalog/resources/`, `POST /api/catalog/import/commit/`
- Change type: enum addition | response fields | request body | mock data | backend model choices
- OpenAPI change: Extends `DataDomainType` with `other`, documents that the data schema summary and resource filter support other-type resources, and keeps existing missing/invalid `domainType` error behavior unchanged.
- Mock examples: `mock/prism/examples/45-domain-schema.json`, `mock/prism/examples/30-catalog-vector.json`
- Frontend reason: The data import page needs a typed catch-all business classification for files that do not clearly match germplasm, community, survey, remote sensing, molecular, genome, or other specialized domains.
- Backend implementation notes: Add `other` to standards and catalog domain choices, expose it in `GET /api/data-schema/summary/`, allow resource filtering by `domainType=other`, and save it during Excel/CSV import commits without adding new permissions.
- Verification: run OpenAPI lint/generation, rebuild Prism mock, run API change request check, focused backend schema/resource/import tests, and focused frontend import tests/typecheck.
- Result: Verified with OpenAPI lint, generated API types, Prism mock rebuild, API docs rebuild, API change request check, Django system check, focused backend schema/resource/import tests, frontend TypeScript checks, import value unit test, and mock example tests. Browser route test could not run because the local Playwright Chromium executable is not installed.

## API-20260703-001 - Superadmin Data Backup

- Status: Verified
- Owner: Frontend/backend implementer
- Endpoints: `GET /api/admin/backups/overview/`, `GET/POST /api/admin/backups/settings/`, `POST /api/admin/backups/targets/test/`, `GET/POST /api/admin/backups/runs/`, `GET /api/admin/backups/runs/{runId}/`, `GET /api/admin/backups/runs/{runId}/download/`
- Change type: new endpoint | request body | response fields | permission behavior | mock data | backend model
- OpenAPI change: Adds typed backup plans, local and S3-compatible object-storage target settings, target connection testing, manual backup task creation, task polling, history pagination, and local archive download. All endpoints require an authenticated built-in `超级管理员` subject; ordinary users remain forbidden even if mistakenly granted `core.manage_data_backup`.
- Mock examples: `mock/prism/examples/22-admin-backup.json`
- Frontend reason: The admin backup page needs a real typed workflow for configuring local/cloud targets, testing cloud parameters entered by superadmin users, starting backups, polling progress, and reviewing history without hand-written DTOs.
- Backend implementation notes: Add a persistent backup run model, TOML-backed backup configuration, local archive target, S3-compatible object-storage target, a lightweight scheduler/management command for automatic runs, operation-log writes for user-triggered configuration and backup actions, and strict response conformance to the new schemas.
- Verification: run OpenAPI lint/generation, Prism mock build, API change request check, focused backend backup API/service tests, frontend typecheck, and focused admin backup page tests.
- Result: OpenAPI lint, generated client typecheck, focused backend backup tests, Django check, mock example validation, and admin backup page lint/type checks passed. Browser rendering test remains dependent on the local Playwright Chromium binary.

## API-20260703-002 - Spatial Query Workbench Summary

- Status: Verified
- Owner: Frontend/backend implementer
- Endpoints: `POST /api/catalog/resources/{id}/query/`
- Change type: response fields | mock data | documentation clarification
- OpenAPI change: Extends `QueryResponse` with `limitExceeded`, `bounds`, and `elapsedMs` so the bottom spatial query workbench can display a real query status, hit summary, returned result extent, truncation warning, and backend timing without inventing frontend-only fields. The endpoint permission remains unchanged: authenticated users must have both `core.query_data` and `core.load_vector_layer`, and must be allowed to access the target resource.
- Mock examples: `mock/prism/examples/30-catalog-vector.json`
- Frontend reason: The new bottom spatial query workbench separates spatial-range querying from the left attribute query panel and needs typed result-summary fields before a temporary result is loaded into the layer tree.
- Backend implementation notes: Measure `vector_store.query_resource` elapsed time, set `limitExceeded` when filtered hits exceed the returned limit, compute `bounds` from returned valid GeoJSON features, and preserve the existing `totalCount`, `returnedCount`, `fields`, `geojson`, and `warnings` behavior.
- Verification: run OpenAPI lint/generation, Prism mock build, frontend typecheck, focused backend catalog query tests, and targeted frontend tests where practical.
- Result: OpenAPI lint, generated API client, Prism mock build, API change request check, frontend typecheck, focused backend query summary tests, and Django system check passed. Running the entire catalog query unit file still hits existing Windows GeoPackage file-lock cleanup failures in unrelated metadata tests.

## API-20260703-003 - Vector Graduated Numeric Symbolization Contract

- Status: Verified
- Owner: Frontend/backend implementer
- Endpoints: `GET /api/layers/`, `POST /api/admin/data/resources/{id}/`
- Change type: response fields | request body | mock data | documentation clarification
- OpenAPI change: Extends `VectorRenderer` with `GraduatedRenderer` and `GraduatedSymbolClass` for existing `symbolization.renderer.type="graduated"`. The schema documents numeric field classification, `equalInterval` and `quantile` methods, class count, precision, color ramps, `classes[].min/max`, no-data default class, visibility, `gm-*` icon IDs, and existing `additionalProperties` compatibility.
- Mock examples: `mock/prism/examples/30-catalog-vector.json` adds a vector point layer whose `symbolization.renderer` classifies `海拔` into five equal-interval ranges using `gm-tree` and a green ramp.
- Frontend reason: The symbolization editor needs a typed continuous-field workflow for elevation, NDVI, salinity, and similar attributes that matches the existing unique-value editing model while preserving generated API contracts.
- Backend implementation notes: No new endpoint, permission, database migration, or server-side classifier is required. Existing JSONField storage, layer serialization, and admin default-visualization save behavior should pass this JSON object through unchanged and keep current permission behavior.
- Verification: run OpenAPI lint/generation, rebuild Prism mock, run focused frontend symbolization tests, frontend typecheck, backend Django check, and production build.
- Result: Verified with OpenAPI type generation, Prism mock bundle injection, Redocly lint, API change request check, focused frontend symbolization tests, frontend TypeScript checks, Django system check, and Vite production build. Redocly continues to report two pre-existing unused schema warnings unrelated to this change.

## API-20260701-002 - Same-Origin Map Thumbnail Tiles

- Status: Verified
- Owner: Backend implementer
- Endpoints: `GET /api/map/thumbnail-tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`
- Change type: new endpoint
- OpenAPI change: Adds a public binary image endpoint for right-side map thumbnail tiles with `z/x/y` path parameters, `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/webp`, `image/avif`, and `image/svg+xml` success responses, and standard error responses.
- Mock examples: N/A; binary tile responses are not represented in Prism examples.
- Frontend reason: Remote client browsers must not depend on direct access to third-party tile domains or stale browser cache for the main workspace thumbnail.
- Backend implementation notes: Proxy Mapbox/OSM according to `application.map`, cache successful tiles under the app data media directory while preserving the real image MIME type, and return a generated local Web Mercator 2D world map tile when the external source is unavailable and cache is empty.
- Verification: run focused frontend thumbnail tests, backend core thumbnail API tests, frontend typecheck, and production build.
- Result: Backend implementation and focused tests are complete; real deployment should verify that browser Network requests for the thumbnail use `/api/map/thumbnail-tiles/...`.

## API-20260618-001 - Non-Geographic Table Analytics

- Status: Blocked
- Owner: Frontend
- Endpoints: none currently declared
- Change type: endpoint design paused
- OpenAPI change: Removes the previously proposed `/api/catalog/resources/{id}/nongeo-analytics/` and `/api/catalog/resources/{id}/table-query/` paths from the canonical contract while retaining frontend-side demo types for local UI exploration.
- Mock examples: Frontend demo only; no backend mock contract.
- Frontend reason: Non-geographic analysis design is not finalized, so backend implementation would lock in premature field profiling, statistics, filtering, and pagination semantics.
- Backend implementation notes: Do not implement non-geographic analytics/query endpoints until the product contract is reintroduced through `docs/openapi.yaml` and a new backend handoff.
- Verification: run `cd frontend && pnpm run generate:api && pnpm run check:api && pnpm run api:changes:check`.
- Result: Deferred by product/design decision; `/nongeo` remains a front-end demo.

## API-20260623-001 - Raster Upload Size And Pixel Limits

- Status: Verified
- Owner: Frontend requester / backend implementer
- Endpoints: `POST /api/raster/import/`, `GET /api/bootstrap/`, `GET/POST /api/admin/settings/`
- Change type: status code | response fields | request body
- OpenAPI change: Documents upload validation for `application.limits.upload_max_mb` and `application.limits.max_raster_side_pixels`; adds `SystemLimits.maxRasterSidePixels` to bootstrap and admin settings payloads; validation failures continue to use the existing `400 ErrorResponse`.
- Mock examples: N/A; existing response schema is unchanged and the behavior is covered by frontend and backend tests.
- Frontend reason: Prevent unsupported large rasters from entering upload/preprocessing and surface immediate Chinese-facing validation feedback.
- Backend implementation notes: Uploaded files must be rejected before job creation when file size exceeds the configured limit or GDAL metadata reports width/height above the configured `max_raster_side_pixels`; `sourcePath` import and scan paths reuse the pixel-size limit.
- Verification: run `cd frontend && pnpm run generate:api && pnpm run check:api && pnpm run api:changes:check`; run focused frontend import tests and backend raster API tests.
- Result: Verified with `pnpm run generate:api`, `pnpm run check:api`, `pnpm run api:changes:check`, focused frontend raster upload tests, and backend raster API tests.

## API-20260623-002 - Raster Upload Storage Name Clarification

- Status: Verified
- Owner: Backend implementer
- Endpoints: `POST /api/raster/import/`
- Change type: request body
- OpenAPI change: Clarifies `name` descriptions so frontend display names are separate from backend unique storage filenames; request and response shapes are unchanged.
- Mock examples: N/A
- Frontend reason: Avoid showing or depending on backend storage names that no longer include original uploaded filenames.
- Backend implementation notes: Browser-uploaded rasters are stored as `uploaded/<uuid><suffix>` while `RasterDataset.name`, `DataResource.name`, and `MapLayer.name` continue to use the submitted display name or original upload stem.
- Verification: run `cd frontend && pnpm run api:changes:check`; run backend raster import tests.
- Result: Backend tests verify uploaded storage filenames do not include original upload names.

## API-20260628-001 - Domain Schema And Germplasm Database Scaffold

- Status: Verified
- Owner: Frontend/backend implementer
- Endpoints: `GET /api/data-schema/summary/`, `GET /api/germplasm/accessions/`
- Change type: new endpoint | response fields | permission behavior | mock data
- OpenAPI change: Adds read-only schema summary response for the confirmed customer data categories and a paginated germplasm accession list response. Both endpoints require an authenticated session and `core.browse_data`; errors use the standard `ErrorResponse`.
- Mock examples: `mock/prism/examples/45-domain-schema.json`
- Frontend reason: Data management needs a stable typed source for the new data classification/catalog skeleton and a first query surface for germplasm resources without hand-written DTOs.
- Backend implementation notes: Add scaffold models for standards/ecology/omics domains, include apps in Django settings, expose read-only summary/accession views, and keep existing `DataResource`, import, raster, and catalog behavior unchanged.
- Verification: run `cd frontend && pnpm run generate:api && pnpm run check:api && pnpm run api:changes:check`; run backend model/API tests for the new endpoints and existing catalog smoke tests.
- Result: Verified with direct OpenAPI lint, OpenAPI type generation, API change request check, Prism mock bundle injection, Django check, focused backend endpoint tests, frontend TypeScript checks, and Vite build. `pnpm run check:api` was not run directly because the script contains `rm -rf`; existing catalog smoke coverage was sampled separately, with catalog startup/layer tests passing and `test_data_query.py` failing only during Windows temporary GeoPackage cleanup due locked files.

## API-20260629-001 - Catalog Resource Domain Type Filtering

- Status: Verified
- Owner: Frontend/backend implementer
- Endpoints: `GET /api/catalog/resources/`, `POST /api/catalog/import/commit/`
- Change type: response fields | request body | status code | mock data
- OpenAPI change: Adds optional `DataResource.domainType`, `GET /api/catalog/resources/?domainType=` filtering, and `400 ImportErrorResponse` examples for missing or invalid import `domainType`. Import commit payload documentation now treats `domainType` as required business classification input and saves it on newly imported table/vector resources.
- Mock examples: `mock/prism/examples/30-catalog-vector.json`
- Frontend reason: The top workspace navigation needs typed geo/non-geo dropdown choices that can synchronize with the left data panel without hand-written DTOs or hidden backend fields.
- Backend implementation notes: Add `DataResource.domain_type`, serialize it as `domainType`, filter resources by valid domain codes, reject missing or invalid import domain codes, store import payload domain types, and default raster catalog sync to `remote_sensing` and scanned gene files to `genome`.
- Verification: run OpenAPI lint, regenerate API types, rebuild Prism mock, run frontend typecheck, Django check, and focused backend domain filter tests.
- Result: Backend and frontend type-level verification passed. Broader catalog tests still hit existing Windows file-lock cleanup failures on GeoPackage/SQLite files, so the domain filter was verified with a focused test class that does not touch those files.

## API-20260630-001 - Built-In Role Permission Baseline

- Status: Verified
- Owner: Frontend/backend implementer
- Endpoints: `GET/POST /api/groups/`, `POST /api/groups/{groupId}/`
- Change type: permission behavior | mock data | documentation clarification
- OpenAPI change: Documents the five built-in roles (`超级管理员`, `平台管理员`, `科研用户`, `普通用户`, `游客`), protected-role delete/rename restrictions, superadmin-only locked permissions, and the `400 ErrorResponse` cases for protected role changes.
- Mock examples: `mock/prism/examples/10-admin-auth.json`
- Frontend reason: The authorization page needs a simpler operational role model where platform administration and data/system administration are merged, while normal users can still upload and view allowed data.
- Backend implementation notes: Create platform-admin and research-user built-in groups, migrate untouched legacy normal-user defaults to the narrower baseline, protect all built-in role names from delete/rename, keep superadmin permissions fully locked, and preserve manually customized role permissions.
- Verification: run OpenAPI lint, regenerate API types, run API change request check, frontend typecheck, Django check, and focused core permission/API tests.
- Result: Verified with direct OpenAPI lint, OpenAPI type generation, API change request check, Prism mock bundle injection, frontend TypeScript checks, Django system check, and focused core permission/API tests. The broader `test_api.py` file still contains unrelated Windows TOML/path compatibility failures when run as a whole.

## API-20260701-001 - Vector Symbolization Unique Value Contract

- Status: ContractReady
- Owner: Frontend/backend implementer
- Endpoints: `GET /api/layers/`, `POST /api/admin/data/resources/{id}/`
- Change type: response fields | request body | mock data | documentation clarification
- OpenAPI change: Defines `VectorSymbolization`, `VectorRenderer`, `UniqueValueRenderer`, and `UniqueValueSymbolClass` for the existing `symbolization` field while keeping `additionalProperties` compatibility with legacy loose style JSON. The schema documents category value merging through `classes[].values`, `gm-*` platform icon IDs, and the `germplasm.dna-sex-tree.v1` default template metadata.
- Mock examples: `mock/prism/examples/30-catalog-vector.json` adds a germplasm DNA point layer whose `symbolization.renderer` classifies `性别` into female, male, and other categories with tree icons.
- Frontend reason: The map symbolization editor needs typed, documented unique-value rules so business default templates and user edits share one contract instead of ad hoc frontend-only objects.
- Backend implementation notes: No new endpoint or database migration is required; existing JSONField storage and serializers should pass the documented `symbolization` object through unchanged. Admin save-visualization payloads should continue to accept this JSON shape under the existing `core.custom_symbolization` UI permission and existing resource-management permissions.
- Verification: run OpenAPI lint, regenerate API types, rebuild Prism mock, run focused frontend symbolization tests, frontend typecheck, and backend catalog layer serialization tests.
- Result: Pending implementation and verification.

## API-20260704-002 - Vector Export Attribute Table Packaging

- Status: BackendReady
- Owner: Frontend/backend implementer
- Endpoints: `POST /api/catalog/export/`, `POST /api/catalog/export/async/`, `GET /api/catalog/export/jobs/{job_id}/download/`
- Change type: documentation clarification | archive content behavior
- OpenAPI change: Clarifies that vector export ZIP files include the requested spatial file plus a same-name `*-attributes.csv` file generated from `GeoJSONFeatureCollection.features[].properties`; request and response schemas are unchanged.
- Mock examples: N/A; binary ZIP response schema is unchanged.
- Frontend reason: The spatial query result export should provide a directly usable attribute table instead of only a GeoJSON file.
- Backend implementation notes: While packaging each vector item, keep existing GeoJSON/Shapefile output and add a UTF-8 BOM CSV attribute table with one row per feature and stable property-column order.
- Verification: run OpenAPI lint, regenerate API types, rebuild Prism mock, run frontend typecheck, and run focused backend export tests.
- Result: Verified with direct OpenAPI lint, OpenAPI type generation, API change request check, Prism mock bundle injection, frontend TypeScript checks, backend export unit tests, and backend export API integration tests.

## API-20260710-003 - Recommended Vector Symbolization Templates

- Status: Verified
- Owner: Frontend/backend implementer
- Endpoints: `GET /api/catalog/resources/{id}/visualization-summary/`
- Change type: response fields | schema fields | mock data | documentation clarification
- OpenAPI change: Adds required `recommendedSymbolizations` to `ResourceVisualizationSummaryResponse`, defines `RecommendedSymbolizationTemplate`, and documents `GraduatedRenderer.templateId/businessType` so unique-value and graduated recommended templates share the same metadata contract.
- Mock examples: `mock/prism/examples/30-catalog-vector.json` includes field-survey habitat and importance recommended symbolization examples under the visualization summary response.
- Frontend reason: The symbolization panel needs typed recommended default templates for germplasm, individual, population, community, and field-survey vector resources, while still allowing users to customize the applied style.
- Backend implementation notes: Generate recommendations from the existing visualization summary read path using resource `domainType`, field alias matching, category counts, numeric distributions, and the platform `gm-*` icon whitelist. No new write endpoint or database migration is required.
- Verification: run OpenAPI lint, regenerate API types, run frontend TypeScript checks, run focused frontend symbolization tests, run backend template unit tests, and compile the touched backend modules.
- Result: Verified with direct Redocly lint, direct OpenAPI type generation, frontend TypeScript checks, `src/symbolization.test.ts`, `backend/tests/unit/catalog/test_symbolization_templates.py`, and Python module compilation. `pnpm run check:api` was not run because the script contains `rm -rf`, which conflicts with the workspace deletion policy.

## API-20260713-002 - Raster Package Import And Persistent Jobs

- Status: BackendReady
- Owner: Frontend/backend implementer
- Endpoints: `POST /api/raster/import/preview/`, `POST /api/raster/import/`, `GET /api/raster/jobs/{job_id}/`, `POST /api/raster/render/`, `GET /api/raster/tiles/{dataset_id}/{style_hash}/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`
- Change type: new endpoint | multipart request | response fields | persistence | permission behavior | mock data
- OpenAPI change: Adds server-side raster package preview, multi-file `files + payload` import, DAT/BSQ/BIL/BIP + HDR and VRT dependency semantics, persistent job `stage`, source package metadata, raster kind, resampling, access groups, and display rules.
- Mock examples: `mock/prism/examples/40-raster.json`
- Frontend reason: IMG/VRT/ENVI files must not be parsed as GeoTIFF in the browser; users need GDAL-backed package validation, companion-file upload, RGB band selection, resampling, permissions, and refresh-safe job status.
- Backend implementation notes: Preserve the legacy single-file field, store new packages under UUID directories with a manifest and SHA256, persist sparse task checkpoints and raster styles in the metadata database, publish catalog records in a short transaction, and restrict server-path imports to `raster/original`.
- Verification: regenerate OpenAPI types, rebuild Prism examples, run frontend typecheck/browser tests, Django checks, raster unit/integration tests, and a real GeoTIFF preview/import smoke test.
- Result: Verified with OpenAPI lint and generated types, bundled YAML/HTML API documentation, Prism example rebuild, API change-request validation, Django system check, the applied raster database migration, 113 raster unit/integration tests, frontend TypeScript checks, 162 frontend tests, and a Vite production build. The provided `Tarim_worldview_1.tif` sample was preflighted as GTiff, 512 x 512, 8 bands, EPSG:32645, with the WorldView natural-color 5/3/2 preset. Browser-mode tests could not start because the configured Playwright Chromium executable is not installed. `makemigrations --check` also reports an unrelated pre-existing `core.BackupRun` index-name drift; no raster migration drift was reported.

## API-20260713-003 - Inventory Business Type Groups

- Status: Verified
- Owner: Frontend/backend implementer
- Endpoints: `GET /api/admin/data/resources/`
- Change type: response field | mock data | documentation clarification
- OpenAPI change: Adds nullable `AdminDataResource.domainType` and clarifies that `inventoryGroups` / `inventoryGroupId` represent user-created custom groups, while “全部数据” and the ten business-type groups are derived system groups.
- Mock examples: `mock/prism/examples/20-admin-dashboard-data.json`
- Frontend reason: The inventory page needs stable automatic grouping by the ten import business types without duplicating those types as manually maintained database groups.
- Backend implementation notes: Serialize `DataResource.domain_type` as `domainType`; no model or migration change is required. Historical blank values remain null and are displayed under “其他类型”.
- Verification: run OpenAPI lint/type generation, API change-request validation, focused backend admin-resource tests, frontend inventory browser tests, and frontend typecheck.
- Result: OpenAPI lint and generated types passed; the API change request and Prism example injection passed; all 17 admin data-resource backend tests passed; frontend formatting, full TypeScript checking, and the production build passed. The browser test could not start because the configured Playwright Chromium executable is not installed.

## API-20260715-001 - Inventory Full Statistics And Group Summaries

- Status: Verified
- Owner: Frontend/backend implementer
- Endpoints: `GET /api/admin/data/resources/`
- Change type: response fields | aggregate semantics | mock data | documentation clarification
- OpenAPI change: Adds required `summary` and `groupSummaries` to the admin data-resource list response. Both are calculated over the complete filtered and permission-scoped queryset, while `items` remains paginated.
- Mock examples: `mock/prism/examples/20-admin-dashboard-data.json`
- Frontend reason: The inventory page currently compares the full `total` with active/inactive counts derived from only the current page, and business/custom groups are sized from paginated items, making existing data appear missing.
- Backend implementation notes: Aggregate total, status, restricted-access, size, item-count, business-type groups, and custom groups before applying pagination. Keep permissions and filtering identical to the item queryset.
- Verification: run OpenAPI lint/type generation, API change-request validation, focused admin data-resource aggregation tests, frontend typecheck/build, and inventory browser tests when Chromium is available.
- Result: OpenAPI lint and generated types passed; API change-request validation, generated API documentation, and Prism example injection passed; all 19 admin data-resource backend tests passed; frontend TypeScript checking and the production build passed. The inventory browser test could not start because the configured Playwright Chromium executable is not installed.
