# huyang_system Agent Instructions

Central Asia Poplar Forest Ecosystem Protection Data Sharing Platform (中亚胡杨林生态系统保护数据共享平台).

These instructions are for AI coding agents working in this repository. Treat every rule below as operational guidance: read the required context, preserve architecture boundaries, keep API contracts synchronized, and report verification results explicitly.

## 1. Project Context

The platform is a browser-based data sharing and visualization system for poplar forest ecosystem protection in Central Asia. It manages multi-source ecological, spatial, monitoring, raster, vector, document, and result data, then exposes that data through authenticated web workflows, map visualization, catalog search, and administrative management.

Read `docs/design-docs.md` before writing code. It is the primary functional and architectural specification, including page structure, feature scope, data model expectations, performance targets, and acceptance criteria.

### Core product shape

- Users enter through one unified login page.
- The main web application contains both user-facing workflows and permission-gated admin features.
- Backend admin is a login-after feature controlled by permissions, not a separate public entry point.
- The UI should be Chinese-facing unless a task explicitly requires otherwise.
- Normal users, researchers, data admins, and system admins have different functional and data-access permissions.

### Primary references

> **Important:** When a decision affects future implementation, summarize it in `docs/`. Do not leave architectural decisions only in code comments, chat history, or commit messages.

## 2. System Architecture

### Technology stack

- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Ant Design, Mapbox GL JS
- **Backend:** Python, Django, GeoPandas, GDAL, Rasterio
- **Business data:** SQLite and application-managed metadata
- **Spatial/vector data:** GeoPackage `.gpkg`
- **Raster data:** Raw raster files, backend-generated PNG/XYZ output, PNG cache
- **Configuration:** TOML for data roots, cache policy, raster symbolization interface, and runtime paths

### Storage boundaries

Program code, business data, and research data must live in separate directory trees.

- Program paths belong to the repository and deployment code tree.
- Business-data root is configured in TOML.
- Research-data root is configured in TOML.
- Subdirectory layout under the data roots is fixed by convention, not configurable per item.
- Never hardcode business-data or research-data roots in application code.

> **Pitfall:** Data path shortcuts are easy to introduce during tests or imports. Keep roots TOML-driven and make tests provide explicit temporary config.

### Backend components

Use Django built-in auth, admin, sessions, groups, and permissions where possible. Do not reinvent user, role, session, or permission systems from scratch.

Backend app boundaries:

- `backend/apps/core/`: configuration, auth integration, permissions, system settings
- `backend/apps/catalog/`: data catalog, resources, vector query, imports, exports
- `backend/apps/raster/`: raster import, preprocessing, symbolization, tiles, async jobs
- `backend/apps/audit/`: operation logs and traceability

Sensitive operations require backend permission checks. Frontend route or button gating is not a substitute for server-side authorization.

### Frontend components

Ant Design is the primary UI library for non-map interfaces. Mapbox GL JS handles map rendering.

Preferred frontend boundaries:

- Map workspace: `frontend/src/pages/MapPage.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/MapCanvas.tsx`, `frontend/src/map/`
- Layer state: `frontend/src/hooks/LayerContext.tsx`, `frontend/src/hooks/useLayerGroups.ts`, `frontend/src/utils/layerFactory.ts`
- Data panel and query/import flows: `frontend/src/components/DataPanel.tsx`
- Admin pages: `frontend/src/admin/`
- API client: `frontend/src/api/client.ts`, using generated OpenAPI types

Do not use an array index as a React `key`. Do not use `!important` in CSS.

### Raster and map rendering

Raster files are never symbolized in the browser.

- Backend Python scripts generate PNG/XYZ output.
- The frontend only loads rendered imagery or tile services.
- Each raster type may have its own symbolization script.
- Raster symbolization scripts must be invoked through the unified stdin/stdout interface.
- PNG cache keys must include raster file identity, symbolization rules, and output size.
- Cache size cap and cleanup policy come from TOML config.

> **Important:** Any raster feature that moves color ramps, classification, resampling, or PNG generation into React violates the architecture. Keep raster computation behind backend services or configured symbolization scripts.

### Performance targets

Use the targets in `docs/design-docs.md` as acceptance constraints:

- Map interaction: at least 20fps where feasible
- Layer operations: no more than 500ms
- Query response: no more than 1s for up to 30k rows
- Layer management: support at least 5 concurrent loaded layers

When changing query, rendering, cache, or layer-state logic, consider these targets. They are not hard requirements but are good guidelines.

## 3. API Contract Rules

All backend API endpoints must be defined in `docs/openapi.yaml` using OpenAPI 3.1.0. `docs/openapi.yaml` is the authoritative contract.

Whenever an API endpoint is added, removed, or modified, including URL, method, parameters, request body, response shape, status codes, permissions, or authentication behavior:

1. Update `docs/openapi.yaml`.
2. Update `docs/developer-guide.md`.
3. Regenerate/check frontend API types when applicable.
4. Implement backend behavior and tests.
5. Implement frontend usage and tests.

### OpenAPI requirements

- Every operation must have a unique camelCase `operationId`.
- All parameters, request bodies, response schemas, and error cases need complete `description` fields.
- Error responses must use the standard `ErrorResponse` schema with a `detail` field.
- Authentication must be declared through `components.securitySchemes`.
- Public endpoints must explicitly declare `security: []`.
- Authenticated endpoints must declare session-based security.
- Permission behavior must be documented in both `docs/openapi.yaml` and `docs/developer-guide.md`.
- Frontend DTO types must come from `frontend/src/api/schema.d.ts`; do not hand-write duplicate backend DTO types.

### API verification

After changing OpenAPI, run:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm run generate:api
pnpm run check:api
pnpm run api:changes:check
pnpm run api:docs
pnpm run api:lint
```

> **Pitfall:** API changes are high-conflict in multi-agent work. Prefer landing contract changes first, then backend implementation, then frontend usage.

### Mock server workflow

- Use Prism for frontend/backend separation. The canonical contract remains `docs/openapi.yaml`; do not create a second hand-written OpenAPI spec.
- Mock response examples live in `mock/prism/examples/*.json`, split by domain. Do not keep growing one large fixture file.
- Build the Prism spec with `cd frontend && pnpm run mock:build`; this generates `mock/prism/openapi.prism.json` from the canonical contract and injects examples.
- Run Prism with `pnpm run mock:api`, or run Prism and Vite together with `pnpm run dev:with-mock`.
- `pnpm run dev:mock` uses `.env.mock` to proxy Vite `/api` to `http://127.0.0.1:4010`.
- Prefer real local names and metadata from `/Users/gx/Documents/Source/huyang_system_data` for examples; when actual data is empty or incomplete, generate small, plausible Chinese-facing examples.
- API errors must be JSON: unauthenticated API requests return `401 {"detail":"请先登录"}` and CSRF failures return `403 {"detail":"CSRF 验证失败"}`. Do not allow API endpoints to redirect to a login page or return Django HTML error pages.

### Frontend/backend separation workflow

Use this protocol when one developer owns frontend work and another developer owns backend work.

- Frontend owns the API contract. `docs/openapi.yaml` is the frontend developer's responsibility because it defines the data shape the UI needs.
- Frontend code must use generated OpenAPI types from `frontend/src/api/schema.d.ts`; do not hand-write duplicate backend DTOs or infer hidden backend fields.
- Frontend expresses data requirements by updating `docs/openapi.yaml` and `mock/prism/examples/*.json`, not by changing backend implementation code.
- If frontend needs a new field, endpoint, status code, permission behavior, or response shape, the frontend developer updates `docs/openapi.yaml`, regenerates/checks `frontend/src/api/schema.d.ts`, and adds or updates a small domain-focused mock example that demonstrates the expected response.
- Every frontend-owned API contract change must also be recorded in `docs/api-change-requests.md`. Keep each entry concise but actionable: affected endpoint, change summary, frontend reason, mock example file, backend implementation notes, and verification expectation.
- Run `cd frontend && pnpm run api:changes:check` after changing `docs/openapi.yaml` or `mock/prism/examples/*.json`; the check fails when contract/mock files change without a tracked API change request.
- Backend implements the API contract. The backend developer reads `docs/openapi.yaml` and matching mock examples, then updates backend behavior and backend tests so real responses conform to the frontend-maintained contract.
- Backend developers should use `docs/api-change-requests.md` as the implementation queue for API changes. Mark entries implemented only after backend behavior, tests, and real response shapes match `docs/openapi.yaml` and the referenced mock examples.
- If backend cannot implement a proposed API shape safely, the backend developer must raise the contract issue and request an OpenAPI change instead of silently returning a different shape.
- Frontend and backend developers must not edit each other's application code without explicit handoff. Frontend-owned work stays under `frontend/`, `docs/openapi.yaml`, generated API types, and mock examples needed to express API needs. Backend-owned work stays under `backend/`, backend tests, and backend-facing API documentation.
- Shared contract files are coordinated, not casually edited. Treat `docs/openapi.yaml`, `frontend/src/api/schema.d.ts`, `mock/prism/examples/*.json`, and `mock/prism/openapi.prism.json` as the handoff surface between frontend and backend.
- `mock/prism/openapi.prism.json` is generated output. Do not hand-edit it; run `cd frontend && pnpm run mock:build`.
- Do not add temporary frontend fallbacks for missing backend fields, and do not add backend compatibility branches for undocumented frontend assumptions. Fix the OpenAPI contract and mock examples first.

## 4. Development Environment

### Package managers and environments

- Use `pnpm` for all frontend dependency and script commands.
- Do not use `npm`.
- Activate the backend Python environment before backend commands:

```bash
eval "$(mamba shell hook --shell zsh)" && mamba activate geomanager
```

### Formatting and checks

Frontend scripts are defined in `frontend/package.json`:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm run format
pnpm run lint
pnpm run check
pnpm run fix
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm test
```

Backend formatting:

```bash
cd backend
eval "$(mamba shell hook --shell zsh)" && mamba activate geomanager
ruff format .
python -m pytest
```

Run the smallest reliable verification set for the changed area. For merge-ready work, prefer the full relevant set.

## 5. Implementation Guardrails

### General rules

- No legacy fallback paths.
- Read existing code and tests before editing.
- Follow local patterns instead of introducing parallel architecture.
- Keep changes small, focused, and reviewable.
- Do not refactor unrelated files while implementing a feature.
- Do not revert or overwrite changes made by another agent unless explicitly instructed.
- Clarify uncertain behavior through tests and documentation rather than hidden compatibility branches.
- Format code before committing.

### Permissions and security

- Use Django permissions and groups where possible.
- Enforce permissions in backend views/services for menus, data resources, queries, exports, admin features, and configuration changes.
- Treat frontend permission gates as usability only; never rely on them as the security boundary.
- Log key operations in the audit app where the action affects data, permissions, configuration, imports, exports, or raster jobs.

### Data and import behavior

- Keep business-data and research-data roots configurable only through TOML.
- Validate imported data structure, field types, coordinate fields, and spatial bounds before accepting it.
- Return structured validation errors that help users correct data.
- Keep catalog classification based on topic, time, space, and source consistent with the design document.

### Frontend behavior

- Use Ant Design for forms, tables, menus, modals, panels, and admin interfaces.
- Use Mapbox GL JS for map rendering and map interaction.
- Keep raster symbolization out of frontend code.
- Keep UI state and generated API DTOs separate; do not hand-write API response duplicates in `frontend/src/types.ts`.
- Preserve responsiveness and avoid UI text overflow in panels, buttons, and tables.

## 6. Multi-Agent Coordination

Assume other agents may be working in parallel. Keep task boundaries narrow, inspect current file state before editing, and avoid unrelated churn. Do not overwrite or revert changes you did not make unless the user explicitly instructs you to do so.

### Task intake

At the start of each task, identify these items from the user request and repository context:

- Background: why the change is needed.
- Scope: files or modules likely to change.
- Out of scope: files or behavior that must remain untouched.
- API impact: endpoints, schemas, permissions, or authentication behavior affected; if none, treat it as no API change.
- Required references: normally `docs/design-docs.md`, `docs/implementation-notes.md`, and the relevant code/tests.
- Verification: the smallest reliable command set for the changed area.

If a task request is missing one of these items, infer it from the repository where safe. Ask the user only when the missing information could cause an unsafe or incompatible implementation.

### Execution roles

Use these role boundaries to choose files and responsibilities. A single agent may perform multiple roles in one task, but keep edits ordered by dependency.

- **Coordinator Agent:** task breakdown, merge order, API conflict tracking.
- **Contract Agent:** `docs/openapi.yaml`, `docs/developer-guide.md`, API examples, generated frontend API types. In frontend/backend split work, this role is owned by the frontend developer unless explicitly delegated.
- **Backend Agent:** Django features by app boundary. Backend agents must not edit React UI code except during an explicit cross-stack handoff.
- **Frontend Agent:** React features by UI/state boundary. Frontend agents must not edit Django code except during an explicit cross-stack handoff.
- **Testing Agent:** verification, failure reproduction, missing tests.
- **Documentation Agent:** implementation notes, testing notes, changelog entries, implementation explanations.

### Frontend/backend ownership

When frontend and backend are developed by different people, use these ownership boundaries:

| Area | Owner | Allowed changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `backend/` | Backend developer | Django views, services, models, permissions, backend tests |
| `docs/openapi.yaml` | Frontend developer | Authoritative API contract defining the data shape required by the UI |
| `docs/api-change-requests.md` | Frontend developer | API change handoff notes that tell backend what to implement |
| `frontend/` except generated API types | Frontend developer | React UI, state, routes, API client usage, frontend tests |
| `frontend/src/api/schema.d.ts` | Generated from OpenAPI | Never hand-edit; regenerate after contract changes |
| `mock/prism/examples/*.json` | Frontend developer | Expected data examples that demonstrate UI requirements; backend verifies real responses against them |
| `mock/prism/openapi.prism.json` | Generated from OpenAPI and examples | Never hand-edit; regenerate with `pnpm run mock:build` |

Cross-boundary edits require an explicit handoff note in the task or completion report. If a frontend task appears to require backend code changes, finish the OpenAPI/mock requirement and hand implementation to the backend owner. If a backend task appears to require contract or UI changes, implement only the backend-compatible part and hand the OpenAPI/UI change to the frontend owner.

### Branch model

When creating a branch, use one branch per task:

```text
codex/<area>-<short-task>
```

Branch examples:

```text
codex/catalog-query-filters
codex/raster-unique-values
codex/admin-user-groups
codex/map-layer-reorder
```

### Conflict-prone files

Avoid editing these files unless the task explicitly owns them:

| File | Default owner | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/openapi.yaml` | Frontend-owned Contract Agent | Authoritative API contract defining frontend data requirements |
| `frontend/src/api/schema.d.ts` | Frontend-owned Contract Agent | Generated API types; never hand-edit |
| `frontend/src/types.ts` | Frontend architecture owner | Separates UI types from API DTOs |
| `backend/apps/core/permissions.py` | Permission owner | Central permission registry |
| `frontend/src/App.tsx` | Frontend architecture owner | Routing and auth gate entry |
| `docs/implementation-notes.md` | Documentation Agent | Shared implementation memory |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Release owner | Release-level summary |

If a required change touches a conflict-prone file, keep the edit minimal and note it in the completion report. For API changes, finish the contract change before backend and frontend implementation.

### Merge order for API changes

1. Contract change: `docs/openapi.yaml`, `docs/developer-guide.md`, generated `schema.d.ts`
2. Backend implementation: endpoint, permissions, service behavior, tests
3. Frontend implementation: API usage, UI behavior, frontend tests
4. Documentation and release notes: implementation notes, testing notes, `CHANGELOG.md`

Small tasks may combine these steps in one change set, but preserve this order while editing and reporting.

## 7. Verification Checklist

Use the checklist that matches the touched area.

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
eval "$(mamba shell hook --shell zsh)" && mamba activate geomanager
python -m pytest
ruff format .
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm run check:api
pnpm test
pnpm run check
pnpm run typecheck
```

### API docs

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm run api:lint
pnpm run api:docs
```

### Completion report

Every completion response must state:

- What changed.
- Which verification commands ran and whether they passed.
- Whether an API contract changed; if yes, confirm `docs/openapi.yaml`, `docs/developer-guide.md`, and `frontend/src/api/schema.d.ts` were updated or explain why not.
- Whether permissions, data paths, or raster rendering changed.
- Remaining risks, especially performance, migration, data compatibility, or deployment risks.

## 8. Versioning and Releases

The project uses Semantic Versioning and Keep a Changelog format.

Version files:

- Frontend: `frontend/package.json`
- Backend: `backend/pyproject.toml`
- Changelog: `CHANGELOG.md`

When handling a release task:

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the new version changes.
2. Bump version using `make version-patch`, `make version-minor`, or `make version-major`.
3. Create a tag using `make tag` or `git tag -a v{version} -m "Version {version}"`.
4. Push changes and tags with `git push && git push --tags`.

Release commands:

```bash
make help
make version-patch
make version-minor
make version-major
make changelog
make tag
```
